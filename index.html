        <h1> Project console :/</h1>
    </body>
    <p>This is Visual Studio Code. In my opinion, I enjoy it. How to set it up? Well, first, of course, you have to download it on your pc or software. Then, to start your code, create a folder. Open up your folder on VIsual Studio Code, make a file in Studio code for the html, and you're all set!</p>
    <p>To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>

    console.log("This is visual studio code");
    var first_name="Aathini";
    console.log(first_name);
    var last_name="Parthiban";
    console.log(last_name);
    var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
    console.log(full_name);
    var name="Hi! I am aathini!";
    var replace_name=name.replace("aathini","Aathini");
    console.log(replace_name);
    var small_case=first_name.toLowerCase(); 
    console.log(small_case);
    var upper_case=first_name.toUpperCase(); 
    console.log(upper_case);
    var sqr_root= Math.sqrt(4); 
    console.log(sqr_root);
    var max_number= Math.max(15,50); 
    console.log(max_number);
    var min_number= Math.min(15,50); 
    console.log(min_number);
    var power= Math.pow(4,2); 
    console.log(power);
